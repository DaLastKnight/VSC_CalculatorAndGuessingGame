# VSC_CalculatorAndGuessingGame
My repository for the source code of the CalculatorAndGuessingGame application that I programmed in C++ in Visual Studio

## Features

- Has 2 Applications built into 1: Calculator and Guessing game on numbers
- Has a built-in toggle to switch/exit the applications

## Additional information

- My first C++ Application
- Challenged myself to do this without tutorials (Only referred for the random function in the guessing game)
- Mainly created to apply my knowledge on switch statements
- I found the {} in switch statements a bit hard to keep track of, hence why I added comments to assist me in handling them
- 148 Lines of code!
