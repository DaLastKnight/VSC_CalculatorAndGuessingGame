# VSC_CalculatorAndGuessingGame
My repository for the source code of the CalculatorAndGuessingGame application that I programmed in C++ in Visual Studio

## Features

- Has 2 Applications built into 1: Calculator and Guessing game on numbers
- Has an in-program toggle to switch/exit between the applications

## Additional information

- My first C++ Application
- Challenged myself to do this without tutorials (Only referred for the random function in the guessing game)
- Mainly created to apply switch statements
- Found the {} in switch statements a bit hard to keep track of, got confused along the way
- 148 Lines of code!
